Hi, Iâ€™m [Kamran Ahammed], a 9th-grade student at Cumilla Collectorate School and College in Cumilla, Bangladesh. I'm passionate about web development and have been learning and building projects for the past two years through Programming Hero.

ðŸ’» I love coding and enjoy creating websites and applications that are not only functional but also visually appealing. I'm particularly interested in front-end development and aim to expand my skills in full-stack development.

âš½ When I'm not coding, you can find me playing football or exploring new technologies. I'm always eager to learn and grow, and I'm working towards becoming a skilled web developer in the future.

ðŸŒ± Currently, I'm working on projects that combine my interests in coding and design, and I'm excited to share them with the GitHub community. Let's connect and collaborate!

ðŸ“« Feel free to reach out to me via LinkedIn or email.
